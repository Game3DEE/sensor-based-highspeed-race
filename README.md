## Three.js, Ammo.js and Physijs racing Game.

We did a race game with [three.js](https://threejs.org).

Used Physic engine: [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) (Framework: [Physijs](https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs)).

Also playable with mobile devices.

Project for the university of applied sciences Fulda (Hochschule Fulda Germany).
